<strong>INSTRUCTIONS</strong>
<p/>
Choose a CSV file -- <em>it must be in CSV format only</em> -- and upload it here. The file must have <em>NO</em> header row, and the last column must be a list of URLs including the leading "http://" or "https://" portions. If you wish to include additional columns, they must all be placed to the left of this URLs column. All columns in your CSV file will be included in the processed output file.
<p/>
Once you've hit the "Process URLs" button, do <em>NOT</em> press the button again. Just wait until the app has pinged all of the URLs, at which point a popup window will appear to save the results to a new CSV file. This new file will contain all of the original file's columns, as well as three additional ones:
<p/>
1) HTTP Code
<br>
2) HTTP Message
<br>
3) Redirect (if applicable)
